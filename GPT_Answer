[
x^{\log3(x) - 2} = 27
]

First, notice that (27 = 3^3). Thus, the equation can be rewritten as:

[
x^{\log_3(x) - 2} = 3^3
]

Now, let's use the property of logarithms that states (a^{\log_a(b)} = b), where (a > 0) and (a \neq 1). In this case, if we can bring the base of the exponent on the left side to 3, we can apply this property. Let's introduce a new variable:

[
y = \log_3(x)
]

Then (x = 3^y), and the equation becomes:

[
(3^y)^{y - 2} = 3^3
]

Applying the property of exponents ((a^b)^c = a^{b \cdot c}):

[
3^{y(y - 2)} = 3^3
]

Now that the bases of the exponents on both sides are equal, we can equate the exponents:

[
y(y - 2) = 3
]

Expanding the brackets:

[
y^2 - 2y = 3
]

Moving all terms to one side of the equation:

[
y^2 - 2y - 3 = 0
]

Solving the quadratic equation:

[
D = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-3) = 4 + 12 = 16
]

[
y{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 4}{2}
]

We obtain two roots:

[
y_1 = \frac{2 + 4}{2} = 3
]
[
y_2 = \frac{2 - 4}{2} = -1
]

Now let's go back to our definition (y = \log_3(x)):

(\log_3(x) = 3) means (x = 3^3 = 27).
(\log_3(x) = -1) means (x = 3^{-1} = \frac{1}{3}).

Both of these values are solutions to the original equation since they satisfy the condition (x > 0).
